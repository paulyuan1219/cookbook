# topic The creation myth
## A
 It is a myth that creative people are born with their talents: gifts from God or nature. Creative genius is, in fact, latent within many of us, without our realising. But how far do we need to travel to find the path to creativity? For many people, a long way. In our everyday lives, we have to perform many acts out of habit to survive, like opening the door, shaving, getting dressed, walking to work, and so on. If this were not the case, we would, in all probability, become mentally unhinged. So strongly ingrained are our habits, though this varies from person to person, that, sometimes, when a conscious effort is made to be creative, automatic response takes over. We may try, for example, to walk to work following a different route, but end up on our usual path. By then it is too late to go back and change our minds. Another day, perhaps.The same applies to all other areas of our lives. When we are solving problems, for example, we may seek different answers, but, often as not, find ourselves walking along the same well-trodden paths.

So, for many people, their actions and behaviour are set in immovable blocks, their minds clogged with the cholesterol of habitual actions, preventing them from operating freely, and thereby stifling creation. Unfortunately, mankind's very struggle for survival has become a tyranny
- the obsessive desire to give order to the world is a case in point. Witness people's attitude to time, social customs and the panoply of rules and regulations by which the human mind is now circumscribed.

## C. 
The groundwork for keeping creative ability in check begins at school. School, later university and then work teach us to regulate our lives, imposing a continuous process of restrictions, which is increasing exponentially with the advancement of technology. Is it surprising then that creative ability appears to be so rare? It is trapped in the prison that we have erected. Yet, even here in this hostile environment, the foundations for creativity are being laid; because setting off on the creative path is also partly about using rules and regulations. Such limitations are needed so that once they are learnt, they can be broken.


## D 
The truly creative mind is often seen as totally free and unfettered. But a better image is of a mind, which can be free when it wants, and one that recognises that rules and regulations are parameters, or barriers, to be raised and dropped again at will. An example of how the human mind can be trained to be creative might help here. People's minds are just like tense muscles that need to be freed up and the potential unlocked. One strategy is to erect artificial barriers or hurdles in solving a problem. As a form of stimulation, the participants in the task can be forbidden to use particular solutions or to follow certain lines of thought to solve a problem. In this way they are obliged to explore unfamiliar territory, which may lead to some startling discoveries. Unfortunately, the difficulty in this exercise, and with creation itself, is convincing people that creation is possible, shrouded as it is in so much myth and legend. There is also an element of fear involved, however subliminal, as deviating from the safety of one's own thought patterns is very much akin to madness. But, open Pandora's box, and a whole new world unfolds before your very eyes.

## E. 
Lifting barriers into place also plays a major part in helping the mind to control ideas rather than letting them collide at random. Parameters act as containers for ideas, and thus help the mind to fix on them. When the mind is thinking laterally, and two ideas from different areas of the brain come or are brought together, they form a new idea, just like atoms floating around and then forming a molecule. Once the idea has been formed, it needs to be contained or it will fly away, so fleeting is its passage. The mind needs to hold it in place for a time so that it can recognise it or call on it again. And then the parameters can act as channels along which the ideas can flow, developing and expanding. When the mind has brought the idea to fruition by thinking it through to its final conclusion, the parameters can be brought down and the idea allowed to float off and come in contact with other ideas.

创世神话
事实上，创意人士并非与他们的才能一生下来的，是上帝或大自然的赐予。创造天才实际上潜伏在我们许多人内，只是我们没有意识到。但要走多远才能找到通往创造力的道路呢？对于许多人来说，需要走很远。在我们的日常生活中，为了生存，我们必须习惯性地执行许多行为，比如开门、刮胡子、穿衣服、步行上班等等。如果不是这样，很可能我们会变得精神失常。尽管这些习惯在人与人之间有差异，但有时当有意识地尝试创造时，自动反应会接管。例如，我们可能尝试沿着不同的路线步行上班，但最终还是走上了平常的路。那时已经太迟回头改变主意。也许下一天吧。

这同样适用于我们生活中的其他领域。当我们解决问题时，我们可能寻求不同的答案，但通常情况下，我们发现自己走在相同的老路上。

因此，对于许多人来说，他们的行为和行为方式都被设置成不可动摇的块，他们的思想被习惯性行为的胆固醇所堵塞，阻止了他们自由运作，从而扼杀了创造力。不幸的是，人类为生存而奋斗的过程已经变成了一种暴政 - 着迷于为世界带来秩序的愿望就是一个例子。看看人们对待时间、社会风俗以及人类思想现在所受限制的各种规则和法规。

保持创造力的基础从学校开始奠定。学校，随后的大学，然后是工作，都教导我们规范生活，强加了一个不断加剧的限制过程，随着技术的进步而不断增加。因此，创造能力看起来如此罕见，是否令人感到惊讶？它被困在我们已经建立的监狱里。然而，即使在这种敌对的环境中，创造力的基础也在奠定，因为踏上创造之路部分地也涉及使用规则和法规。这些限制是必需的，一旦学会了，它们就可以被打破。

真正有创造力的思维常被视为完全自由和无拘束。但更好的比喻是一个思维，它可以在需要时自由，同时也认识到规则和法规是可以随意提高和放下的参数或障碍。这里可以举一个训练人类思维创造力的例子。人的思维就像需要得到释放和潜力解锁的紧绷肌肉。一种策略是在解决问题时设立人为的障碍或障碍物。作为一种刺激，任务的参与者可能被禁止使用特定解决方案或遵循某些思维线路来解决问题。通过这种方式，他们被迫探索陌生领域，这可能会导致一些惊人的发现。不幸的是，这种锻炼的困难以及创造本身的困难在于说服人们创造是可能的，因为它被笼罩在如此多的神话和传说中。然而，这个过程中还涉及到一种恐惧因素，即使在潜意识层面，偏离自己思维模式的安全性非常类似于疯狂。但是，打开潘多拉的盒子，一个全新的世界就会展现在你眼前。

设立障碍也在帮助思维控制观念而不是让它们随机碰撞中扮演了重要角色。参数充当了观念的容器，从而帮助思维集中在它们上。当思维在横向思考，大脑不同领域的两个观念相互交汇时，它们形成了一个新的观念，就像原子在空中漂浮然后形成分子一样。一旦观念形成，就需要将其包容，否则它会飞走，因为它的通过是如此瞬息。思维需要将其固定一段时间，以便能够认识它或再次调用它。然后，参数可以充当观念可以流动、发展和扩展的通道。当思维通过深入思考将观念推向最终结论时，可以降下参数，让观念飘离并与其他观念接触。
