Topic #1: Individuals in the West will improve the plight of the world’s poor coffee farmers if they boycott coffee companies that refuse to buy and sell “fair trade” coffee.

For the Idea:

Consumer Power: Consumers have the power to influence the behavior of corporations by choosing to spend their money with ethically responsible companies. Boycotting companies that don't support fair trade can pressure them to change their practices.

Promoting Fair Trade: Supporting fair trade through boycotts can help raise awareness about the plight of poor coffee farmers and the need for fair compensation. This can lead to more widespread adoption of fair trade practices.

Economic Incentives: A boycott can financially impact companies that don't support fair trade, potentially forcing them to reconsider their stance and engage in more ethical sourcing.

Against the Idea:

Complex Supply Chains: Coffee supply chains are complex, and not all coffee companies have easy access to fair trade sources. Boycotting might not be a practical or immediate solution for some companies, which could disrupt the entire supply chain.

Unintended Consequences: A blanket boycott of all non-fair trade coffee companies may harm not only the corporations but also the very farmers we want to help. It could lead to job losses and income reduction for small coffee farmers.

Alternative Solutions: Instead of a boycott, consumers could encourage companies to adopt fair trade practices through constructive engagement and support for legislation and regulations that promote ethical coffee sourcing.

Topic #2: Coffee companies in the West should be required by law to only buy and sell “fair trade coffee.”

For the Idea:

Ethical Standards: Enforcing fair trade coffee sourcing through legislation sets clear ethical standards that protect small coffee farmers from exploitation and ensure they receive fair compensation.

Long-term Sustainability: Mandatory fair trade practices contribute to the long-term sustainability of the coffee industry, as it encourages environmentally friendly and socially responsible farming methods.

Level Playing Field: A legal requirement ensures that all coffee companies are on a level playing field, eliminating the competitive advantage some may gain by exploiting cheap labor.

Against the Idea:

Market Constraints: Mandating fair trade may limit the availability of affordable coffee options, potentially excluding consumers with lower budgets from enjoying coffee.

Supply Chain Complexity: The global coffee supply chain is intricate, and enforcing fair trade standards could be challenging and costly for both businesses and regulators.

Economic Impact: The coffee industry is a significant part of the economy in some regions. A blanket legal requirement could have unintended economic consequences, potentially leading to job losses in the coffee industry.


## Paul's Opinion

### topic 1
From my point of view, each topic has its pros and cons. It's better consider all the possible outcomes before simply supporting or denying one topic.

The pros are as follows:
1. Good usage of customer power: In the end, customers have the ultimate voting power. They can choose to buy coffee from ethically responsible companies. Therefore, this may give some pressure to companies to turn to "fair trade" coffee.
