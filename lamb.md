# [FORK TENDER LEG OF LAMB (SLOW ROASTED WITH POTATOES)](https://www.craftbeering.com/slow-roast-lamb-leg-dijon-mustard-rosemary-marinade/#Recipe-card)

## INGREDIENTS
- 1 leg of lamb, about 5 lbs*
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 4 cloves garlic, minced or pressed
- 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
- 3-4 sprigs rosemary, chopped very fine + more for garnish
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp coarse salt 
- 1 tsp pepper
- 3 lbs Gold potatoes (baby gold or Yukon gold)
- 1 cup lager**

## INSTRUCTIONS
1. Preheat oven to 300-325 F depending on how strong (300 F for fan assisted oven).
2. Pat dry the leg of lamb, score the fatty parts with a sharp knife. Mix the finely chopped rosemary, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, salt and pepper and olive oil to form a paste. Rub all over the lamb.
3. In a large roasting pan pour the chicken stock. Place the roasting rack on top and position the prepared leg of lamb in the center of the rack. Cover with aluminum foil and slow roast for about 3 hours***.
4. Uncover the lamb and check for progress - bone(s) should be cleanly exposed and meat just starting to become tender and pull away. Add the potatoes, replace rack with lamb leg and add lager (or extra stock or water). Cover and roast for another 1 to 1.5 hours, depending on how large the leg.
5. Remove the foil completely and continue roasting for about 30-45 extra minutes in order for a crust to form and the meat to become completely tender (test with fork to see if it easily falls apart).
6. Before serving, loosely tent the lamb leg with foil and allow to rest for a few minutes. Save all the pan juices and serve alongside the lamb and potatoes - they make a delicious sauce, no gravy needed.


## NOTES
- *Depending on size and cut a lamb leg's weight can average from 4 to about 6.5 lbs. If chump and shank are attached it will weigh more, if boneless considerably less. Total slow roasting time will depend on the size/weight/style of cut. Budget about 50-60 minutes per pound of lamb meat. Read post for more details.

- **German or Czech pilsner, Munich helles or American craft lager recommended.

- ***If your pan does not have roasting rack, slice an onion across into 3 thick circles, place them at bottom of pan and rest meat on top. If the leg of lamb weighed less than 4 lbs (usually when boneless) reduce this time increment to 2.5 hrs.
