## Question
Are you willing to pay more for coffee that you know is registered “fair trade”? If so, how much more are you willing to pay?

## Answer

I am more than happy to pay more for coffee that is registered as "fair trade". This label assures that my purchase supports small coffee farmers and helps to protect the environment. I feel proud of making this type of contribution. Currently, I can afford "fair trade coffee" which is up to 50% more expensive than its "non-fair" alternatives. Even though this sounds like a lot of money, in reality, the amortized cost per day is quite low.
