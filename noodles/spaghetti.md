# [Instant Pot Spaghetti](https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/instant-pot-spaghetti/)

## Ingredients
- ▢1 pound (454g) spaghetti
- ▢1 pound (454g) ground beef
- ▢1 tablespoon (15ml) olive oil
- ▢4 cups (1L) unsalted chicken stock (or water)
- ▢Kosher salt and ground black pepper

## Instructions 
1. *For Dump-and-Go-Meal: Skip the browning, sauteing, and deglazing steps below. Make sure to break the ground beef into smaller chunks. Then layer the seasoned ground beef chunks, onions, garlic, dried herbs at the bottom of the pot.
2. Optional Flavor Booster - Brown Ground Beef in Instant Pot: Heat up Instant Pot using "Sauté More" function. Wait until it says "HOT" (~8 mins). Add 1 tbsp (15ml) olive oil in Instant Pot. Make sure the oil is coated over the whole bottom. Add in 1lb (454g) ground beef, then season generously with salt & ground black pepper. After browning for 5 minutes, discard the ground beef juice. With a wooden spoon, break the ground beef apart into smaller chunks. Allow the ground beef to brown. Stir occasionally until they are slightly crisped (~5 – 7 mins). Taste then adjust with more salt & ground black pepper.
3. Saute Onion & Herbs: Add in diced onions, minced garlic, 1½ tsp (1.8g) dried basil, and 1½ tsp (1.2g) dried oregano, then saute for another 2 minutes.
4. Deglaze Instant Pot: Pour 1 cup (250ml) unsalted chicken stock in Instant Pot. Then fully deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom with a wooden spoon. Give it a quick mix.
5. Pressure Cook Spaghetti: Add in 3 tbsp (45ml) regular soy sauce, remaining 3 cups (750ml) unsalted chicken stock. Break 1 lb (454g) spaghetti in half, then add spaghetti in Instant Pot. Layer 1 large can (28oz) whole peeled tomatoes or Marinara sauce on top. Do not mix. With Venting Knob in Venting Position, close the lid, then turn Venting Knob to Sealing Position. Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 3 minutes, then Natural Release for 5 minutes. Release remaining pressure, then open the lid.
6. Thicken & Season: The spaghetti sauce will look liquidy at first, and the spaghetti is about 85% - 90% cooked.
Use the "Saute More" function (press "Cancel" and "Saute") to bring the content back to a simmer. With a wooden spoon, break down the tomatoes, then stir a few minutes to fully cook the spaghetti and thicken the sauce.
Taste and season with roughly 3 - 4 large pinches of salt. Turn off the Instant Pot.
7. Serve: Garnish with freshly grated Parmesan cheese, then serve this tasty spaghetti. Enjoy!~
