At a first glance, the populations in BC and Alberta share many similarites. For example, among all the provinces and territories in Canada, these two provinces' populations are pretty close to each other, where BC has around 600K people more than Alberta. Therefore, it's highly meaningful to compare these two populations. Give the fact, we may ignore the actual population numbers and turn to the corresponding distribution of different age groups within each province. Below are some primary distributions among the following three groups: 0 to 14 years, 15 to 64 years, 65 years and over .

- Alberta: 0.19, 0.69, 0.112
- BC: 0.14, 0.67, 0.18

From these numbers, it's much easier to see the differences between these two provinces. Apparently, Alberta has more children and young teenages. In fact, even though Alberta has a smaller population, its population between 0 to 14 years outnumbers BC's counterpart by 90K. This is a huge difference. There must be some significant factors leading to this difference. The real estate price could one main reason. But there should be more. Another interesting finding is that the percentage of the 65+ group in BC is much higher. This completely makes sense, given that the weather in BC is much better and more elder-friendly.

In conclusion, these data reflect some interenting trends in populations among provinces. With deeper analysis, we may unveal more interesting and useful finding.
