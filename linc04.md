# Part 1

Lee Timson (LT): Good morning. This is Lee Timson from River Education Books. May I know whom I am talking to?

Henry Sknirb (HS): Hello, this is Henry Sknirb.

LT: Hello, Mr. Sknirb. How can I help you today?

HS: I'm calling about the books I ordered for my English class. I just received the books. But they are in terrible shape. They're falling apart. I don't think my students are willing to pay for them.

LT: I'm really sorry to hear that. This is tatally our fault. I assure you that you are entitled to a full refund.

HS: Thank you very much. A refund will be great. Could you show me how to do that?

LT: Sure. The return process is easy. I will email you a shipping label. Please pack all the books in one package and attach a printed label. Then you may drop it off at any post office convenient to you. There's no extra charge involved.

HS: That sounds simple. Thank you.

LT: I am happy to help. In addition, please keep one copy to yourself, as a compensation from us. We value our business and strive to honor every customer.

HS: That's very sweet. I will keep the copy. Thanks again.

LT: Welcome. Is there anything else I could help today?

HS: That's all for today. Thank you very much for your great help. I really appreciate it.

LT: My pleasure. Wish you a wonderful day. Bye.

HS: You too. Bye.  

# Part 2: An email to complain something
Dear Sir or Madam,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to address your recent email in which you mentioned that you are unable to provide any documents pertaining to the debt incurred through my overdraft account with CIBC. I appreciate your prompt response, and I want to clarify the situation by providing some proof to support my claim that I do not owe any money to CIBC.

Attached to this email, you will find a document that outlines the account history and balance associated with my overdraft account at CIBC. This document clearly shows that there is no outstanding debt or balance owed to the bank. I believe this evidence should help in resolving any discrepancies and concerns regarding the debt in question.

I have also consulted with CIBC staff locally, who have confirmed that my account is clear and advised me to disregard any communications from debt collection agencies. I understand that you have closed the account on your side and have requested CIBC to do the same, and I appreciate your cooperation in this matter. I would like to ensure that any remaining issues are fully resolved.

If you or CIBC require any additional information or have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me via email. I am more than willing to assist in any way to resolve this matter promptly.

Thank you for your attention to this issue, and I look forward to a swift resolution.

Best wishes,

-Wei Yuan
