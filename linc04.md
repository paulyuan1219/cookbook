Lee Timson (LT): Good morning. This is Lee Timson from River Education Books. May I know whom I am talking to?

Henry Sknirb (HS): Hello, this is Henry Sknirb.

LT: Hello, Mr. Sknirb. How can I help you today?

HS: I'm calling about the books I ordered for my English class. I just received the books. But they are in terrible shape. They're falling apart. I don't think my students are willing to pay for them.

LT: I'm really sorry to hear that. This is tatally our fault. I assure you that you are entitled to a full refund.

HS: Thank you very much. A refund will be great. Could you show me how to do that?

LT: Sure. The return process is easy. I will email you a shipping label. Please pack all the books in one package and attach a printed label. Then you may drop it off at any post office convenient to you. There's no extra charge involved.

HS: That sounds simple. Thank you.

LT: I am happy to help. In addition, please keep one copy to yourself, as a compensation from us. We value our business and strive to honor every customer.

HS: That's very sweet. I will keep the copy. Thanks again.

LT: Welcome. Is there anything else I could help today?

HS: That's all for today. Thank you very much for your great help. I'd really appreciate it.

LT: My pleasure. Wish you a wonderful day. Bye.

HS: You too. Bye.
