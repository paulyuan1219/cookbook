Henry Sknirb (HS): Hello, this is Henry Sknirb. I'm calling about the books I ordered for my English class from River Education Books. They arrived, but they're in terrible shape. They're falling apart, and I can't ask my students to pay that much for something that isn't made well. I hope the other products from River Education are better made.
