    *Note: The USDA recommends 165°F (74°C) as the safe internal temperature for cooked chicken. If the temperature is off by more than 10°F, quickly place the chicken breasts back in Instant Pot. Close the lid, then let the residual heat in Instant Pot cook the chicken breasts for 1 - 2 more minutes. If not, let the chicken breasts rest until it reaches 165°F (74°C). For Reference, our chicken breasts jumped to 165°F (74°C) after resting for 3 minutes.
