To whom it may concern

I am writing to enthusiastically recommend Enzo Jiang, a Grade 12 student whom I have had the privilege to know since September 2023, for admission to your esteemed instition. As a homestay family member, I have closely observed Enzo's character, academic performance, and extracurricular involvement. I am quite convinced that he possesses the qualities and potentials to excel in a university setting.

First of all, Enzo is an individual of outstanding character. He is humble, polite and warm-hearted. Enzo never hesitates when people around him need any help. What's more precious is that Enzo never takes credits afterwards. This makes him popular among families and friends.

Academically, Enzo's performance is mixed. In subjects that capture his interest, Enzo demonstrates an impressive level of engagement, often going above and beyond the requirements. It is not uncommon to find Enzo dedicating time to his homework late into the night, showing his commitment to excellence. This diligence is particularly noteworthy, given his ability to balance these efforts with his personal passions. On the contrary, in subjects that are not attractive, Enzo shows significantly less interests, leading to occasional lapses in punctuality or missed deadlines. However, it is important to view these moments as part of his journey towards maturity. They do not detract from his overall potential but rather highlight areas for growth. I firmly believe that with the right guidance and encouragement, Enzo will continue to develop a more consistent approach to all his endeavors.

Last but not least, Enzo's passion for sports, particularly soccer, is a defining aspect of his character. As far as I knew, he's been a outstanding amteur soccer player since elemetntry school. In fact, one main reason that Enzo chose LSS from the beginning was to play soccer games on behalf of the school. Despite the setback of not being selected for the school soccer team, Enzo's love for the game remains undiminished. Enzo's commitment to practicing soccer regularly, regardless of weather conditions or the long distance to the local field (one hour round-trip on foot), demonstrates about his resilience and determination. This unwavering dedication to pursuing his interests, even in the face of challenges, is a quality that will serve him well in all areas of life.

In conclusion, Enzo's intelligence, persistence, and genuine character indicate immense potential. I am confident that once he identifies his passions, Enzo will achieve remarkable success in his university or college pursuits. 

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require further information or wish to discuss Enzo's application in more detail.

Sincerely,

Wei Yuan
